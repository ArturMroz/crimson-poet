# Crimson Poet

Text generator implemented in Ruby using [Markov Chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain).

Inspired by [this article](https://howistart.org/posts/clojure/1/).

The generator was trained on the art of Edward Lear and Taylor Swift and creates ungodly abominations like:

> Birds in wondrous flight! On a balcony in summer air. See the lights, see the face Of the fool, no, I don't like your kingdom keys, They once belonged to me. You asked me for a your way through the crowd, And say, "Hello." Little did I know... That you were trouble when you lie You said the gun was mine Isn't cool, no, I don't know if you know who you are until you lose who you are until you lose who you are.

> Jam, and jelly, and bread are the best of food for me! But the longer I live on the whole world knows, That Pobbles are happier without their toes." I think - I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him. It was losing me. Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago I was a scarlet letter. And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."
